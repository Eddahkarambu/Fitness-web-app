        <p>
          Aerobic exercise is physical exercise of low to high intensity that
          depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process. "Aerobic"
          is defined as "relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen", and
          refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via
          aerobic metabolism adequately.
